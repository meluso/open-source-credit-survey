1. In my experience, open-source projects range beyond code and can also include creation and release of educational material to the public. In some of these scenarios where your role is not just creating a PR with code contributions, I sometimes felt a pressure to keep up and make sure my role was still useful to the team. 

In a 2/3/more people team, it was hard to identify accountability - some team members would take all the credit for a task, so it was important for me to pipe up and keep clearly stating my contributions.

2. In my experience, I have either had to withdraw my contributions after some time with the project to focus on my full-time work or the project gradually closed down. As expected, this does diminish the efforts I+others put into the foundation of the work as the project grows on, and is eventually at its end-of-life.","On the question from the previous page on how contributions for tracking for the project (GitHub, documentation, …): I found myself naturally ranking these on what tracking method meant more to me in terms of “credit”. E.g., to me “GitHub contributors” is often an automatic byproduct and in my experience, does not imply that the open-source organization is directly recognizing your efforts but it is a tangible way of keeping track of contributions for a long time (appears on your profile). So in some scenarios, we might value one over the other - I thought this might be worth considering for your research. 

Thank you for the great survey! It’s been a while since I’ve thought of my contributions to open-source - through this survey, I recognize the primary motivator of (others and my) open-source contributions is to do good to the community without many expectations. Credit reinforces the need to help and is a part of the picture some may see as non-essential, while others see as worth it.",1,2,3,4

The best situation is when the project is open to accept different methods of giving credit. For example, when in the past you needed 2 commits (in code) to get funds for a hackfest, now you can get funds even if you're not a programmer and you contribute with marketing skills, community management etc. The most reliable metrics are stored in the memory of people who constantly hand out and know what's happening. If they drop out, so does a lot of project value/knowledge/processes, and past credit they observed of other people.","Counting tasks or git issues, can be super misleading. People can comment on an Issue and get credit just for participating, which should be appreciated. But there is no good solution for people who spend several hours writing an Issue or an Issue comment. Time spent on a task is not considered, nor are skill levels. Often programming/coding is seen as the only valid contribution type, and everything else is seen as trimmings and less valuable. FOSS projects are usually badly lead, because they're lead by programmers, and they don't traditionally pick up much leadership skills. This lack of leadership skills causes invisible damage in missed contributions that were deterred by badly lead projects. Not having a strong central leadership ""the left hand not knowing what the right hand is doing"" is also a cause of frustration because a lot of contributed effort is wasted because larger tasks can't be finished without a wider collaboration.
